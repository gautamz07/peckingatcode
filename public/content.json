Basically you assign the tasks a time constrain and then write the word ‘FAIL’ besides it , this lowers the mental pressure on you’re self. Adding the time constrain basically enables you to not be stuck on the same tasks for hours on end and adding the word ‘FAIL’ rids you of the pressure or guilt of not completing it. This type of a to do task comes in handy when you’re working on something that’s basically R&amp;D or you’re likely to procrastinate. Win taskWin tasks is basically a task that i would usually add to the beginning of my day, just to kick off my day and give me the feeling that i have accomplished something meaningful right at the offset of the day.
