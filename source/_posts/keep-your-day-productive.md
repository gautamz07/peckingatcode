Alright class , lets take a dive into what are some of the simple habits/tips/tricks that you can use to keep your day produvtive snd end up with a day which seems 'satifying'. Bear in mind , effort can be seen by people watching you but satisfaction can't be , because its something that you feel at the end of the day just before you turn off the lights and go to bed.

## You are not infallable. Use a system
Have a rough schedule , eg. 8:30 - 10:00 is the time frame in which i shower , meditate and have my dinner. Its written in a evernote and my brain everyday does't have to process as to what do i have to do that this point in time. I just do it, on auto-pilot. 

## Use technology to assit you.
Tired of your mobile addiction. stop relying on the old-school technique of self-control and use an app called lock-out, set  time and it will auto lock you out for that duration. tired of your irregular sleeping patterns , use Alarmy , an amazing alar app that will, blast a music that will force you to wake up and solve math problems. These ofcourse are spefic solutions to specific problems, but you get the idea.

## Don't get stuck up on one task. Have aleast 3 (not multi task, i'll explian)
