Alright class , lets take a dive into what are some of the simple habits/tips/tricks that you can use to keep your day produvtive snd end up with a day which seems 'satifying'. Bear in mind , effort can be seen by people watching you but satisfaction can't be , because its something that you feel at the end of the day just before you turn off the lights and go to bed.

## You are not infallable. Use a system
Have a rough schedule , eg. 8:30 - 10:00 is the time frame in which i shower , meditate and have my dinner. Its written in a evernote and my brain everyday does't have to process as to what do i have to do that this point in time. I just do it, on auto-pilot. 

## Use technology to assit you.
Tired of your mobile addiction. stop relying on the old-school technique of self-control and use an app called lock-out, set  time and it will auto lock you out for that duration. tired of your irregular sleeping patterns , use Alarmy , an amazing alar app that will, blast a music that will force you to wake up and solve math problems. These ofcourse are spefic solutions to specific problems, but you get the idea.

## Don't get stuck up on one task. Have aleast 3 (not multi task, i'll explian)


## Drop tasks as you go, in order to have a list of task that you will accomplish.
Having things on your todo list is not an accomplishment , getting them done is, there are centain tasks that will streact their timeline or will just have a lower priority and hence in order for you to stay focused while important tasks don't bother you in the background, drop the less important task. 

Another example of where i use this rule, is when i plan out my saturday and sunday tasks , usually its a combined todo list that i have for the weekend. If for example i don't accoplish 50% of the tasks on saturday , i drop some of the weekend tasks. This is done so that i am not stressed out on sunday and can lazer focus on what i setout to do.

## Keep a single task for the last productive hour.
A more specific rule for the above one, but for good measure. On a typical weekday, you've slogged out the whole day and have very little left in the tank. don't overestimate how much you can do. Just keep one single task to be done and do it !!. Having multiple tasks to do will only tangle your brain.

## Have a not to-do list.
